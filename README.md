## E-commerce Transactions Data Analysis
### Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model building, and Clustering techniques applied to E-commerce Transactions data. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and build models for enhanced targeting and marketing strategies.

### Key Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the E-commerce dataset to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
Lookalike Model: Built a model to identify similar customer profiles based on transaction behavior.
Clustering: Applied clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on their spending and transaction patterns.
Dataset
The project uses an E-commerce Transactions dataset containing customer details, product information, and transaction data.

### Insights
Spending Patterns: Identified spending and transaction frequency differences across customer segments.
Targeted Marketing: Enabled region-specific marketing strategies based on customer segmentation.
Segmentation Quality: Clustering improved with the retention of outliers, as seen in the DB Index and Silhouette Score.
